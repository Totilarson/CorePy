# CorePytools package
```
CorePytools (CorePy) applies machine learning cluster algorithms to geological samples of core. 
- The primary focus of CorePy is to classify high resolution X-ray fluoresence data into chemofacies 
- unsupervised and supervised clustering tools are applied
- Folder structures are developed to simplify working on multiple cores and formations
- Visualizations are used to validate clustering results.
```

# Installation
```
1) pip install corepytools
- corepytools includes commonly applied functions that are called by different Python scripts
2) Additional notes and tips about GitHub and steps I use are here: https://github.com/Totilarson/MyCheatSheet 
- fork the CorePy repo to your github account
- make a local clone:
 - command line: `git clone https://github.com/Totilarson/CorePy.git` 
 - if it is necessary to delete the local clone use: 'rm -rf .git*'
3) Navigate to the local repo //CorePy/ and inspect folders 'CoreData' and 'CorePycodes'
```

# Data examples
```
- CoreData folder contains an example of a high reoslution XRF dataset and corebox photographs
- Naming patterns for core box sticker location, wireline depths, and elemental concentrations are shown 
```
# Settings.py and PCAexample
```
1) In //CorePy/CorePycodes open 'settings.py' and 'PCAexample'
- 'settings.py' contains variables for all the Python scripts
 - "CoreOfStudy", "Depth_model", "Formation", and "RockClassification" should match values in Public_XRF.csv datafile
- Running PCAexample.py will build additional output folders and run PCA-Kmeans.
- Output files are in output folder. CSV file includes additional columns of data
- Settings.py writes a Run_settings.json file that is accessed by other scripts
- Machine learning parameters for Neural model and XGBoost clustering have been added to settings
```
# CoreBeta file
```
- <corename>.json files are stored for each core in //CorePy/CoreData/CoreBeta
- files provide core-specific data that is referenced in each script
- Wireline scripts also write data to the .jsom file
```

# Corebox_Crop.py
```
- This code does take trial and error to get the bounding parameters correct
- line 38 "corepy.cropCorebox((70, 125, 740, 920)" those four values are to be adjusted
- line 17: core_depth = 3978. This is adjusted to match core box photos
- Corebox photos are unique and it takes time to get this part correct
```

# CorePy_plotting.py 
```
1) provides additional elemenal plotting
 - elemental cross plots. Elements are selected from Run_settings['Elements_plotted']
 - elements plotted with respect to depth: Depth model selected by: Run_settings['Depth_model']
 - element box plots. majors and trace
 - pie chart of chemofacies abundance
 - Depth referenced chemostrat column output in a folder //CorePy/CoreOutput/CrossSection/
``` 
 
# NN_Build.py and NN_apply.py
```
- these scripts build and apply results from supervised chemfoacies classifications
- An example training dataset is included in //CorePy/CoreData/CoreNeuralModel
- model parameters are output _XGB and __NN files in //CorePy/CoreData/CoreNeuralModel
- output .csv file has additional classification columns

```

# Coreimage.py
```
- Designed to overlay chemofacies results on corebox photographs
- Requires coreboxphotographs be converted to 'coretubes'
- Coretubes are created from Corebox_Crop.py
- Coretubes are depth registered and in folder //CorePy/CoreData/CoreTubes/

```

# Attribute_merge.py
```
- Merges attribute data from //CorePy/CoreData/CoreAttributes/<core name> with XRF output file
- The files are merged based on Core-box-inch input from the XRF and attribute files
- output is a .csv file that merges XRF and attribute data
```

# Core_attribute.py
```
- This is a plotting function and develops descriptive stats for each chemofacies based on attributes
- Core_attribute.py is run after Attribubte_merge.py
- output is a .csv file with descriptive statistics
- Box plots and depth plots show attribute results with respect to chemofacies
- It is necessasry to add "Attribute_plotted" to the core .json file
```
